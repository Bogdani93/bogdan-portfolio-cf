                <h1>About OneSite!</h1>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>OneSite was born out of a real need identified by our Sales team and CEO. They noticed that event
                    managers were struggling to create online, in-person, and hybrid events quickly and easily.
                    Traditional
                    event planning tools were too complicated and time-consuming, which often led to events that were
                    poorly
                    executed and failed to meet the expectations of attendees.</p>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>OneSite was designed to solve these problems by providing a simple and intuitive platform that allows
                    events managers to create events in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools.
                    As a UX/UI designer I worked to create a user-friendly interface that is accessible to everyone,
                    regardless of their technical skills. With OneSite, event managers can focus on what really matters:
                    creating unforgettable experiences for attendees.
                    The first version of the platform will focus on the launch of Onesite and it will be aimed at
                    obtaining
                    leads and inviting our possible clients to try out the product.</p>

                <h2>Understanding what the clients need</h2>
                <p>To develop OneSite, we first had to understand the needs of our clients. We worked closely with our
                    Sales
                    team to gather feedback from clients who were struggling with event planning. This feedback was
                    essential in developing a platform that would meet the needs of our clients. We listened carefully
                    to
                    their pain points and worked to develop solutions that would address them.

                    I used a variety of techniques to understand the clients' needs, including user interviews and
                    surveys.
                    This allowed us to gain valuable insights into what our clients were looking for in an event
                    planning
                    tool. By leveraging our Sales team's interactions with clients, we were able to create a platform
                    that
                    is not only easy to use but also addresses the specific needs of event managers.</p>

            <section id="research" class="container">
                <h2>User research</h2>
                <p>After gathering feedback from our Sales team and clients, the next step was to analyze the data and
                    transform it into actionable insights. I conducted an in-depth analysis of the feedback to identify
                    common pain points, needs, and expectations. From there, I developed user personas to represent the
                    different types of event managers who would be using OneSite. These personas were based on the needs
                    and
                    characteristics of our clients, and allowed me to better understand their goals and priorities. By
                    developing these personas, I was able to prioritise features and functionalities that would be most
                    useful to our clients.

                    Our user-centered design approach ensured that OneSite was tailored to the needs of event managers
                    and
                    provided them with a seamless experience when planning their events. Ultimately, the personas helped
                    me
                    to better understand our clients, their needs, and how OneSite could help them achieve their goals.

                <h2>User personas</h2>
                <p>Through our analysis of the feedback, I identified three major user groups for OneSite. These groups
                    were further divided into two groups based on their spending habits, some valuing the price the most
                    while others were not really bothered by the budget.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first group comprises event managers who may struggle with technology due to their limited
                        technical skills.</li>
                    <li>The second group consists of tech-savvy event managers who are comfortable with technology and
                        expect project-related costs only.</li>
                    <li>The third group is tech-savy and values simplicity and wants a platform that can be set up
                        quickly and easily in as few steps as possible with his team.</li>

                    <h2>Low fidelity wireframes</h2>
                    <p>As I began creating the wireframes, I was able to collaborate with the product team to
                        iterate and refine the designs based on their feedback. By starting with low-fidelity
                        wireframes, I was
                        able
                        to
                        identify potential design issues early on in the process, saving time and resources in
                        the
                        long
                        run.
                        This process allowed me to create a solid foundation for the final product design that
                        met
                        the
                        needs
                        of both the stakeholders and the end-users.</p>

                    <p>High-fidelity wireframes were a critical component in the design process for OneSite.
                        These
                        wireframes
                        served as a detailed visual representation of the product's user interface, providing a
                        clear
                        understanding of the product's layout, functionality, and user experience.

                        These high-fidelity wireframes were crucial in conveying the design vision to
                        stakeholders
